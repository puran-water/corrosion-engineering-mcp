"""
MCP tool implementations for corrosion engineering.

Tools are organized by tier:
- Tier 0: Handbook lookup (semantic search)
- Tier 1: Chemistry (speciation, Pourbaix)
- Tier 2: Mechanistic physics (uniform, galvanic, barriers, CUI, MIC, FAC)
- Tier 3: Uncertainty quantification (Monte Carlo)
"""

# Tier 0 exports will be added as implementations are created
# Tier 1-3 exports will be added in future phases
