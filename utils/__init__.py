Utility modules for corrosion engineering calculations.

This package will contain utility functions for:
- NORSOK M-506 wrapper (dungnguyen2/norsokm506)
- MULTICORP port (ported from MATLAB)
- NRL galvanic solver (ported from MATLAB/C#)
- Electrochemical models (Butler-Volmer, Tafel, mixed-potential)
- Mass transfer correlations (Sherwood, Chilton-Colburn, Paolinelli-Nešić)
- Coating database management
- Material property lookups
- Uncertainty propagation

To be implemented in future phases.
